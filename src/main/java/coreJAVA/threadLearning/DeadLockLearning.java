/*

    Deadlock is a programming situation where two or more threads are blocked forever,
    this situation arises with at least two threads and two or more resources.

    To analyze a deadlock, we need to look at the java thread dump of the application,
    we need to look out for the threads with state as BLOCKED and then the resources itâ€™s waiting to lock,
    every resource has a unique ID using which we can find which thread is already holding the lock on the object.

    Avoid Nested Locks, Lock Only What is Required and Avoid waiting indefinitely are common ways to avoid deadlock situation
